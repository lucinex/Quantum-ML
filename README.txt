** Abstract **
Quantum Computing is paving a new field for complex and parallel computation of data. With the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) 
technology, it is possible to simulate 4-12 qubits on real time quantum devices and with new companies entering this field, the growth 
is suspected to be rapid in the coming years. In this report we take a gloss over some of the aspects of quantum domain of machine 
learning and use it to classify viz segment skin colored pixel from other randomized pixels. The accuracy result from four types of 
algorithms, two classical and two quantum is presented and the conclusion drawn from my experience with the report could be summarized 
as ‘more amount of research and work is required for quantum machine learning algorithms to mature and outperform present day core 
classical Machine learning and Deep learning techniques, but that day is not nigh’.
